üõí Final Exam Project: Product Page Application
This project is a React-based e-commerce application built using Vite. The application displays a list of 20 products fetched from an API, and allows users to view detailed information about each product. The project also includes navigation between the product list and product detail pages, using React Router.

Displays a list of 20 products on the main page.
Shows product price, title, photo, and rating.
Allows users to click on a product to view detailed information on a new page.
Includes a back button for easy navigation.
Follows best practices for project setup, state management, and UI design.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: Fast frontend build tool for modern web projects.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser.

React Router DOM: Declarative routing for React.

Styled-Components: CSS-in-JS library for styling components.

Fetches data based on the product ID.
Includes a back button to return to the product list.
3. State Management
Uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) to manage component state.
ProductContext is used to share state across components.
4. Routing
Uses react-router-dom to handle navigation between pages.
useParams is used to extract product IDs from the URL for fetching product details.
